About this manual 

                    This manual describes the TM500 configuration and control API. The TM500 is controlled by scripts generated by  
                    the TM500 Script Editor that are run using the MDL (Mobile Data Logger) application using the Mobile Command  
                    Interface (MCI). It is also possible to use the API underlying these scripts to control the TM500 directly. The  
                    TM500 Command Reference Manual provides guidance needed for these commands, their syntax and parameters.  
                    This manual an in-depth description of the TM500 script commands that can be generated using the Script Editor

1.1                  TM500 R10 HSPA system overview 

                    The SUE Test Mobile is a laboratory-based system that simulates the operation of a mobile telephone. It enables  
                    operators to develop and run test scenarios designed to test node-B operation and to log tests and measurements  
                    for detailed examination and analysis of test results. The TM500 R10 HSPA builds upon earlier variants (for  
                    example, HSDPA, HSUPA, HSPA+, DC-HSDPA and DC-HSUPA) and includes the following key features: 

                        •    Simultaneous reception of up to four contiguous cells in a band  and up to 4 non-contiguous  cells in dual  
                            band mode. 

                        •    Simultaneous transmission of E-DCH to two adjacent cells. 
                        •   Use in conjunction with 4C-HSDPA and DC-HSUPA to give a peak single-UE uplink data  rate of 23 Mbps  
                             and downlink data rate 0f 168 Mbps and is compatibile with earlier TM500 releases. 

                    The TM500 R10 HSPA SUE release is compatible with earlier releases up to WSB1.3.1 of the TM500 R9 HSPA  
                    Platform C product family (currently in L1L2 mode only). 

1.1.1                Updating scripts created with earlier TM500 releases 

                    For the TM500 R10 HSPA release, and subsequent releases, a different version of the core protocol is used than  
                    that found in earlier TM500 products. This has resulted in a change to the interface for some of the L2 commands  
                    and the need for additional commands to be issued.  

                    The details of how to implement these changes when updating existing TM500 scripts manually are listed below.  
                    More specific details can be found for each command in the relevant sections of this document. 

                         1.  Add the following command to the start of the first script that uses L2 (BCH is most likely). Please note  
                             this only needs to be done once per run. 

                             FORW PTE CMAC_CONFIG_UE_REQ  

                             See section on CMAC Configure UE for parameters 

                        2.   Decide if the service is Circuit Switched or Packet Switched. 

                                                                47000/046 Issue 30

    •    Circuit Switched: 

         Add the following commands to the start of the service, either UL or DL, for each RAB ID, making  
         sure the RAB ID matches that used in the other CRLC/PTE commands. 

         FORW PTE CCUCSR_SET_ROUTING_REQ 

         FORW PTE CCSR_RAB_ESTABLISH_IND 

    See Restrictions for usage details. 

    •    Packet Switched: 

         As for CS, add the following commands to the start of the service, either UL or DL, for each RAB ID,  
         making sure the RAB ID matches that used in the other CRLC/PTE commands. In addition the RB ID  
         in the PDCP configuration should match that used in the RLC, and the mode (TM, UM, AM) must be  
         the same as that configured in the RLC. 

         FORW PTE CRABM_RAB_ESTABLISH_IND (One command for up to 11 RABs) 

         FORW PTE CRABM_RAB_ESTABLISH_IND (One command for up to 11 RABs) 

         FORW PTE NBRABM_ACTIVATE_REQ (One command for each Radio Bearer) 

3.  Ensure the command ordering in the scripts complies with that recommended in Appendix A Command  
    Sequencing on page 363 . This is especially true for reconfiguration. 

4.  Modify the CMAC CCTrCH to comply with the new interface parameters (R109 only). 

    This applies to both Tx and Rx, although the parameters are different for each. 

                              The additions below are per logical channel and so unused parameters must also be  
                              added to make the positions of the parameters correct. 

    : 

    •    Tx CCTrCH: 

         Insert the following parameters into the position identified in the command  
         CMAC_CONFIG_RX_CCTRCH_REQ. CN Domain ID (This must match the domain used, 0=CS, 1=PS) 

    •    Rx CCTrCH: 

         Insert the following parameters into the position identified in the command  
         CMAC_CONFIG_RX_CCTRCH_REQ. CN Domain ID (This must match the domain used, 0=CS, 1=PS). 

         TTI Length (0-10ms, 1=20ms, 2=40ms, 3=80ms) to match that used in L1 

5.  If using an UL Test Pattern in the PTE, the value for SDU size has been modified from bytes to bits. For  
    existing scripts the number should be multiplied by 8 to give the value in bits. 

6.  For example: 

     Forw PTE USERPTE ADD TESTPATTERN 0 0 8 1 37 1 80 -1 

    Where 37 = SDU size in bytes, would become 

     Forw PTE USERPTE ADD TESTPATTERN 0 0 8 1 296 1 80 -1 

    This is a particular case where the SDU size was rounded up to an integer number of bytes and the interval  
    reduced to give the same data rate. It may be beneficial in this case to change the SDU size to match the  
    exact TB size, so that RLC transparent mode will work correctly. In this case, the command would change  
    to:

                           Forw PTE USERPTE ADD TESTPATTERN 0 0 8 1 148 1 40 -1 

                          Where the interval is reduced to 40ms because the SDU size has halved to 148. 

                       7.  Optional. If using PTE UL data entities, it is advisable to use flow control in the PTE. This allows L2 to  
                           control the rate at which data is sent across from the PTE to L2, thus avoiding an RLC discard. This may  
                          be of particular benefit if using a continuous PN sequence at a high SDU rate. 

                           See USERPTE FLOW_CONTROL for parameter details.  

                       8. When deleting the service, ensure that the CS or PS entities that have been set up are deleted.

1.1.2              Updating scripts to R10 HSPA support 

                   The TM500 R10 HSPA SUE release is compatible with scripts created on earlier releases, as described in Section  
                   1.1.1 Updating scripts created with earlier TM500 releases . 

                   However, if any pre-existing script is updated to set the UE HS-DSCH category to indicate 4C-HSDPA support  
                   (category 29 to 32) then the script may not function correctly unless due regard is given to the RF frequency  
                   configuration and HSDPA Cell Contex. See Section 3.1.7 Dual-Cell E-DCH configuration terminology for further  
                   details. 

1.2                Operating the TM500 

                   TM500 is controlled with commands via the Mobile Control Interface (MCI). The recommended method of  
                   controlling the TM500 by using test scripts generated by the TM500 Script Editor, and run using the Mobile Data  
                   Logger (MDL). The TM500 is supplied with two Windows-based applications that enable complex test scenarios  
                   to be created and run using an intuitive interface. These applications are: 

                       •  TM500 Script Editor 

                          Used to create, validate, and edit test scripts.  

                       •  TM500 Mobile Data Logger 

                          Used to run test scripts, and to log and replay measurement data. 

                   These applications are supplied with the TM500 to provide a reliable method of creating and running test scripts  
                   more reliably than by writing scripts manually.  

1.2.1              TM500 Script Editor 

                   The Script Editor is a Windows-based application that provides a 3GPP functional level GUI that is used to  
                   assemble sequences of commands.The Script Editor simplifies the generation of command scripts in the following  
                   ways:

                       •  It encapsulates the TM500 command-set into a clearly defined set of macros (or Script Commands). One  
                           script command within the script editor can define one or several TM500 MCI commands.  

                       •  It enables the user to save sequences of command scripts as templates. 
                       •  It allocates resources between commands and provides appropriate values for indices used by the  
                           commands (for example, PhCH index). 

                       •  It checks command sequencing and ensures the correct order of commands associated with each macro by  
                          being able to validate a command group. This ensures that the corresponding commands can be run  
                           stand-alone on the TM500. 

                   Automatic checking of scripts generated by the Script Editor makes them less prone to error by ensuring valid  
                   sequences and consistent parameter values are used. For example, some layer 2 MAC commands have over 1000  
                   parameters that must all be included in the correct order. Manually editing such script parameters makes errors  
                   almost inevitable. 

                   The Script Editor is backwards-compatible with earlier TM500 (except for Multi-UE) and TM100 versions, and  
                   can open group files created by these applications. 

                   For information about using the script editor see the TM500 Script Editor User Guide. 

1.2.2              TM500 Mobile Data Logger 

                   The Mobile Data Logger (MDL) application provides you with a test and measurement interface to the TM500. It  
                   enables you to construct, schedule, and execute complex test scenarios, to examine measurements and results in  
                   real time, and to export test data for later analysis. 

                   The MDL can be operated through a user interface or as part of an automated test system using the MDL Proxy  
                   MCI.  

                   The MDL user interface enables the operator to: 

                       •   Start the TM500 and send MCI commands to run test scenarios. 
                       •  Define logging tasks and manually start and stop logging.  
                       •  Display charts during data collection and manually trigger conversion to text format. 
                       •  Replay previously logged measurements. 
                       •  Launch related applications, such as the TM500 Script Editor 

                   Proxy MCI enables an external program to fully control the MDL and TM500, to configure test scenarios, and  
                   collect logged data. 

                   For information about using MDL see the TM500 MDL User Guide.  

1.2.3              TM500 test modes 

                   TM500 provides two main test modes to assist in validation and verification of the Node B and RNC functionality  
                   and performance: 

                       •  Layer 1 Test Mode  

                           This covers all functionality below the MAC-d (that is, Layer 1 plus MAC-i operation). 

                          Layer 1 Test Mode is sub-divided into MAC-i and MAC-d modes, so called because their data termination  
                          points are the MAC-i PDU and MAC-d PDU respectively. All modes are described in Chapter 2 TM500  
                           Test Modes on page 38. 

                          MAC-i Test Mode allows the verification of Layer 1 operation, including the transmission and reception of  
                          R10 HSPA physical channels. Within MAC-d Test Mode the full PDU disassembly and re-ordering  
                          mechanisms can be tested.

                         Layer 1 / Layer 2 Test Mode allows the RLC functionality to be tested in full. In addition, TM500 4C-HSPA  
                         provides the option of RLC Transparent Mode (TM), which although not required by 3GPP, allows  
                         simplified testing of Layer 1 / Layer 2. 

1.2.4             Command addressing syntax  

                  The L1TT, L1TI, and L2 commands have different prefixes to ensure that they are addressed correctly. Layer 1  
                  and Layer 2 command requests must be addressed to their respective test entities in the TM500 by adding a prefix  
                  to each command to specify the name of the test entity. 

                      •  Layer 1 Configuration Commands are prefixed with: 

                          FORW L1TT 

                         The syntax is: 

                          FORW L1TT <CommandSyntax> <PARAMETERS> 

                         Example: 

                          FORW L1TT AddTF 0 0 336 0 

                      •   Layer 1 Test Commands are prefixed with: 

                          FORW L1 

                         So the syntax is: 

                          FORW L1 <CommandSyntax> <PARAMETERS> 

                         For example: 

                          FORW L1 SetHSDSCHCategory <PARAMETERS> 

                      •  Layer 2 Commands (CMAC, CRLC and USERPTE) are prefixed with: 

                          FORW PTE 

                         The syntax is: 

                          FORW PTE <COMMAND> <PARAMETERS> 

                         For example: 

                          FORW PTE CRLC_CONFIG_TX_AM_ESTABLISH_REQ 5 0 336 0 08 2 4 4 100 500 0 0 200 128

1.2.5             Layer 1 and Layer 2 command synchronization 

                  There are some synchronization rules to follow to ensure that synchronous configuration, delete, or reconfiguration  
                  are performed successfully at Layer 1 and Layer 2. This applies to all L1 and L2 commands that use absolute CFN  
                  timing. 

                  Absolute CFN timing 

                  When operating in L1L2 mode, absolute CFN timing (TIMING_TYPE = 3) must be used to synchronise Layer 1  
                  and Layer 2. For synchronous configuration, delete, or reconfiguration to work properly, it is essential that the  
                  configure, delete, and reconfiguration commands have the same CFN value for associated commands in Layer 1  
                  and Layer 2. Using absolute CFN timing ensures this. 

                  Use of WAIT FOR CFN TIME 

                  Layer 1 and Layer 2 respond to timed commands in different ways:

                                                          Chapter 1 Introduction 

                       •   Layer 1 performs a calculation on the requested CFN to compensate for system latency within the TM500.  
                           This latency equates to approximately 34 frames.  

                       •   Layer 2 relies on PHY indications from Layer 1 to provide a timing reference.  

                   This poses a problem for synchronous configuration, delete, or reconfiguration if a command is issued during the  
                   latency period. To overcome this, the script must: 

                       •   Issue the command SendCfnTimeIndication with a suitable CFN time x+1. 
                       •   Wait for the CFN time indication response. 
                       •   Issue the timed commands for synchronous configuration or delete at CFN time x.  

                   The CFN value used in the SendCfnTimeIndication command should be the same value plus 1 as the CFN  
                   intended for the synchronous configuration, delete or reconfiguration. For example, a CFN time of 201. This gives  
                   the maximum amount of command processing time before the next cycle of CFN 200 occurs, which allows both  
                   the L1 and L2 timed commands to start at the CFN within the same cycle:  

                       1.  The command SendCfnTimeIndication is issued with an CFN value of 201. 

                       2.  The MDL command WAIT FOR "CFNTIME" is issued to ensure that the script has enough time to execute  
                           fully before the activation time of the services. 

                   Figure 1 shows how the CFN cycles every 256 frames within the SFN cycle.

1.3                 Transport Monitoring Interface 

                   The Transport Monitoring Interface (TMI) enables you view the received CCTrCH data or transmitted data in  
                   ASCII format. To do this, connect to the TM500 internet port using a telnet client or similar TCP/IP client software.  
                   Monitor the TM500 ports as follows: 

                       •   Port 5400 for all downlink data output by the L1TT. 
                       •   Port 5401 for all uplink data transmitted by L1. 

                   The TMI for TM500 DC-HSPA includes a format for the post reordering queue MAC-d PDU display. 

                                       For 4C-HSDPA configuration (with 2 PowerPC and 7 DSP cards) the monitoring of UL transport  
                                       block is not supported  

                                       However, equivalent information in the transport block can be gathered by enabling specific  
                                       mask (using LogAnalyze application)

1.3.8              MAC-hs TDI Composite Data Format 

                   The data output to the TDI from a MAC-hs queue is the re-ordered MAC-hs PDUs. It includes a header that  
                   provides the MAC-d PDU size information to enable the disassembly and synchronisation to the data stream. Each  
                   PDU starts on a byte boundary. 

                   The format is as follows: 

                    <HEADER><SIZE_INFO><NO_OF_MAC-HS_PDUs><MAC-D_FLOW_ID><MAC-HS_PDU>…<MAC-HS_PDU> 

                   Where: 

                    Field                          Meaning 

                    <HEADER>                       A 16-bit fixed header that is used to synchronise to the binary data stream. 
                                                   The value of the header is 0xFACE. 

                    <SIZE_INFO>                    A set of eight 8 PDU size files, corresponding to the SID codes 0 … 7 in order. 
                                                   Each value is 16 bits. The PDU size range is 1 … 5000 bits. 

                    <MAC-D_FLOW_ID>                An 8-bit value that provides the MAC-d flow ID in the range 0 … 7. 

                    <NO_OF_MAC-HS_PDUs>            An 8-bit value that provides a count of the number of MAC-hs PDUs aggregated in this  
                                                   packet. 
                                                   Range 1 … 32, corresponding to the maximum reordering queue window size of 32. 

                    <MAC-HS_PDU>                   A MAC-hs PDU as defined in [12], section 9.1.4. 

                   Information additional to the raw MAC-hs PDUs is provided to enable disassembly to MAC-d PDUs by an  
                   application. The SID to PDU size mapping information is provided by <SIZE INFO> and the queue to MAC-d  
                   flow mapping is provided by <MAC-D FLOW ID>. The PDU count value is also provided to enable multiple PDUs  
                   to share the size and flow mapping information. This is particularly relevant where a queue stall occurs and up to  
                   32 PDUs might need to be delivered on receipt of a single PDU from Layer 1. 

                   The <HEADER> word enables an application to resynchronise to the binary data stream. The <HEADER> sequence  
                   is not guaranteed to be unique, but it is considered very likely that resynchronisation would be achieved within 2  
                   packets. 

                   Supported in L1 and L2 modes only. Not supported in Protocol mode.  

1.3.9              MAC ehs PDU TMI 

                   The TMI format for MAC-ehs PDUs before the reordering queue is shown below. 

                   If the CRC check fails, the decoded transport block is displayed.

1.4                   High speed data logging of E-DCH 

                      A number of utilities are supplied with the TM500 for High Speed Data Logging (HSDL) of the E-DCH encode  
                      chain. Using the utilities the test logging points are configured and then the resulting data is captured and formatted. 

1.4.1                 Selecting HSDL test points 

                      To select HSDL test points in the E-DCH encode chain the HsdlEDchData test command (see HsdlEDchData on  
                      page 242) is used. This allows independent control of data logging from the test points shown in Figure 2.

                                                                                                                                   Interleaving

                                                                                                                                             data 

                      The data at the input and output of the rate matching block is logged as three separate blocks. These contain turbo  
                      systematic, parity1 and parity2 bits.  

1.4.2                 Capturing and formatting HSDL data 

                      Three batch files are provided to control the capture and formatting of the HSDL data. These batch files are run  
                      from a command prompt in the TM500 application directory. To start the command prompt, run the following  
                      shortcut from the Windows start menu: 

                       Start > Programs > Aeroflex > TM500 > DC-HSDPA > W1.0.0 > HSDL Command Prompt 

                      Two approaches can be used to capture and format the logged data: 

                          •   A single stage process 
                          •   A two stage process 

                      The single stage process is simpler to use, but the two stage process can sustain higher data rates without  
                      discontinuities occurring in the logged data. 

1.4.3                 Single stage data capture and visualisation 

                      For this approach, run the following batch file from the command prompt in the TM500 directory:  

                       hsdl_e_dch_log.bat 

                      This batch file calls the program loganalyse.exe which captures the logged data and decodes it. The decoded  
                      data can be displayed in the command prompt window or can be piped to an output file. The batch file takes the  
                      PPC IP address as its first argument, and an output file name as an optional second argument. For example: 

                       hsdl_e_dch_log.bat ip-address [output-file] 

                                                                     47000/046 Issue 30

                                                                               24

1.4.4             Two stage data capture and visualisation 

                  For this approach, run the following batch files from a command prompt in the TM500 directory:  

                   hsdl_e_dch_capture.bat 
                   hsdl_e_dch_view.bat 

                  The first batch file calls socket_log.exe which captures the logged data from the PPC in a binary format and  
                  takes the PPC IP address and the name of the logged data file as arguments. For example: 

                   hsdl_e_dch_capture.bat ip-address log-file 

                  The second batch file calls loganalyse.exe which decodes the binary data from the logged data file. The  
                  decoded data can be displayed in the command prompt window or piped to an output file. The batch file takes the  
                  name of the logged data file as its first argument, and an output file name as an optional second argument. 

                   hsdl_e_dch_view.bat log-file [output-file] 

1.4.5             Discontinuities in HSDL data 

                  If the ethernet link cannot pass HSDL data fast enough, a discontinuity is caused in the logged data and  
                  flow-control indications are indicated by FLOW CONTROL ON and OFF messages that are inserted into the logged  
                  data stream. 

1.5               Configuring User Data 

                  This section provides a guide to the internal behaviour of the L1TT entity and a guide on how to set up a DL  
                  CCTrCH channel. Configuration of RACH and UL channels is similar. 

1.5.1             L1TT data configuration model 

                  The L1TT must source and output UL or DL data messages for a CCTrCH every 10ms. For example, if a DL  
                  CCTrCH contains only one transport channel with a TTI of 40ms, messages are received every 10ms. However,  
                  only one in every four contains valid transport channel data. 

                  If the CCTrCH is UL, the L1TT provides Layer 1 with a message every 10ms, but the message only contains valid  
                  transport channel data depending on the TTI specified in the transport format for that transport channel.

The features shown in the illustrations are: 

     •   Data ports are logical end-points for inputs and outputs of transport channel data. On one side of the data  
         ports, transport channel data is input (UL) and multiplexed together to form a CCTrCH, or demultiplexed  
         and output (DL) when a CCTrCH receive indication is received from Layer 1.  

     •   Data entities contain information about the data inputs and outputs. 
     •   The configuration process allocates data entities of the required type, and supplies the additional  
         information required by each particular type of data entity. For example, for a FFG, the buffer contents is  
         specified. 

     •   Additionally, the configuration associates each data entity (identified by the INSTANCE_NUMBER  
         parameter) with a specific data port (identified by the DATA_PORT parameter). The data ports are then  
         associated with a transport channel when configuring a CCTrCH with the DATA_PORT parameter. This  
         creates a routing from a specific CCTrCH transport channel to a specific data entity.

     •     Each CCTrCH supports a maximum of eight transport channels. The actual number used is specified during  
           CCTrCH creation by the NUM_TRCH parameter. This determines the number of DATA_PORT  
           parameters required. 

                                           Data entity instance numbers must be unique for a particular type of data entity. UL

In the case of the loopback data entity, shown in Figure 5, one data entity is connected to both an uplink and a  
downlink data port, as illustrated. A ring buffer is allocated for each loopback data entity to enable each uplink and  
downlink to loopback its own data. 

Specific examples for the different types of data entity are shown below. 

                                The data entities associated with a CCTrCH are automatically freed on CCB deletion when  
                                the delete indication is received. For backwards compatibility the L1TT does not reject  
                                deletion commands for automatically deleted data entities.

                          This involves specifying a DL data port that each TDI data entity is bound to. The socket port number is  
                          derived from the DE instance number:

1.5.7              Uplink TDI configuration 

                   The Uplink TDI allows the uplink transport channel data to be derived from a TCP/IP socket, enabling a third-party  
                   application to source the uplink data. 

                   You can specify whether the transport block data is bit or byte aligned: 

                       •  If it is bit aligned (the default), then the transport blocks are output as a continuous series of bits. 
                       •  If it is byte aligned, and the TB size is not divisible by 8, then any remaining TB bits are allocated to an  
                           entire byte (from MS to LS) with any unused bits in the last byte set to a filler.  

                          The next TB is assumed to start on a byte boundary.  

                   The procedure to configure a Transport Data Interface to source uplink data is as follows: 

                       1.  Configure a TDI Data Entity for each Transport Channel that will be present in the UL CCTrCH.  

                          This involves specifying an UL Data Port that each TDI Data Entity will be bound to. The socket port  
                          number is derived from the DE instance number: 

                           # configure an UL TDI – DE Instance 0, to input from socket port 5410 
                           # associated with Data Port 8, Byte aligned (1) 
                           forw l1tt CfgDEULTDI 0 8 1 

                       2.  Create the UL CCTrCH with the DATA_PORT parameter for the transport channel required to be  
                           associated with the data entity set to the data port index (8). 

                   The data entity is deleted as follows: 

                   # Delete UL TDI – DE Instance 0 

                   forw l1tt DelDEULTDI 0  

                   After configuring the test mobile with this command, an application is required as the source for an uplink transport  
                   channel to supply binary data (TCP/IP format) on to the TDI port 541x, where x the DE instance (0 to 9).

                                                         SUE Command Reference Manual 
                                                                   Chapter 1 Introduction 

                      The test mobile reads data from this port at the same rate as the uplink transport channel data rate. Thus a binary  
                      data stream, with a data rate equal to the test mobile capability (for example, 64kbs with CR1.2, 144kb/s with  
                      CR2.3 or 384 kbs with CR4.2) is packaged by the test mobile into transport blocks on the uplink transport channel. 

                                                 In bit-aligned mode the TDI binary data stream is unformatted raw data. The L1TT packages  
                                                 this data into transport blocks and inserts no other data. The uplink produced by the L1TT is  
                                                 exactly the data flow input into the TDI port, although the start and end of transport blocks  
                      :                          may be at the start or end of a byte.  

                                                 In byte-aligned mode a transport block always occupies a self-contained series of bytes. 

                                                 In both modes if the data is input at a data rate lower than the L1TT CCTrCH data rate, then  
                                                 the data is buffered until a complete transport block of data can be sent out. In such a case,  
                                                 the uplink consists of transport blocks consisting only of the TDI input data interspersed with  
                                                 transport block with filler data. This compensates for the disparity between the TDI input and  
                                                 the CCTrCH data rates. 

1.5.8                 Loopback configuration 

                      The loopback data entity is used to re-transmit on the uplink the data received on the downlink. 

                      Configure the loopback data entity providing an index number, the uplink data port, and the downlink data port, as  
                      illustrated in the following command example: 

                       # configure a Loopback data entity – DE Instance 0,  
                       # associated with UL Data Port 0 and DL Data port 1 
                       forw l1tt CfgDELoopback 0 0 1 

                      The data entity is deleted as follows: 

                      # Delete Loopback – DE Instance 0 

                      forw l1tt DelDELoopback 0  

                      The loopback data entity always operates in bit-aligned mode. This means that the data looped back to the uplink  
                      appears exactly as it was received on the downlink, with no padding to fill to byte boundaries. 

                                                 The loopback is compliant with 3GPP specifications, UE test mode 2 only, except for the  
                                                 following: 

                                                 An under-run (insufficient DL data to send on the UL) results in the insertion of defined filler  

                      : 

                                                 data rather than undefined data. 

                                                 An overrun is handled by buffering the DL data rather than truncating it on a transport block  
                                                 by transport block basis. Should the buffer become full the oldest data is discarded. 

                                                 Loopback operation is dependent on the configured UL CCTrCH TFC_MODE, i.e. the  
                                                 manner used to select a TFC on the UL. 

                      There are two modes of operation possible when using loopback: 

                           •   Static 

                               In which a fixed data rate is used on the uplink. Requires the UL CCTrCH to use TFC_MODE 0, i.e. the  
                               same TFC is used continuously. 

                                                                      47000/046 Issue 30

     •   Dynamic 

         In which the uplink data rate may vary in accordance with the availability of downlink data. Requires the  
         UL CCTrCH to use TFC_MODE 2, i.e. the TFC is selected from the TFCS by the L1TT in accordance with  
         the amount of data to be transmitted – this being determined by the amount data received on the downlink. 

These two loopback modes are described in more detail below. 

                           TFC_MODE 1, in which the contents of the TFC cycle table is used to rotate through a  
                           defined list of TFCs, cannot be used with loopback. 

: 

Static loopback mode 

Static loopback mode is provided to allow you to manually control the configuration of the data to be looped back.  
A single TFC is used continuously, so the UL data rate is constant on the transport channel. 

Static mode restrictions 

There are restrictions when using the loopback data entity. In the uplink the TFC_MODE must be set to 0, so that  
only the first defined entry for the UL CCTrCH in the TFC table is used.  

For the loopback data entity to deliver data from a DL TrCH to an UL TrCH the UL and DL TrCH overall data  
rates must match using the equation TBSize x No TBs/TTI. For example:  

(164 x 1) / 40ms  ==  (164 x 2) / 80ms 

This ideally requires a single TFC to be used in the DL as well. 

If the DL does not deliver sufficient data to fill an UL transport block set, then the UL transport block set consists  
entirely of filler data (0x99). 

When the DL consistently delivers data at a higher rate than the UL can transmit, eventually the loopback buffer  
overflows and data loss occurs. In this case the data used on the UL is the last data received on the DL. The oldest  
data is discarded. 

Matching of UL and DL data rates is not checked (to allow the flexibility to use multiple TFC's on the DL). The  
user must ensure that data rates match. 

Use of the loopback data entity requires that the configuration is performed in the following order: 

     1.  Configure the Loopback Data Entity. 

     2.  Configure the Downlink CCTrCH (including TrCHs, TFs, and TFCs). 

     3.  Configure the Uplink CCTrCH (including TrCHs, TFs, and TFCs). 

Dynamic loopback mode 

Dynamic mode is provided to automate the TFC selection, in order to loop-back the data efficiently. The L1TT  
selects a TFC from the defined set, and so able to cope with discontinuities in the downlink data. 

To select dynamic mode the UL CCTrCH TFC_MODE is set to AUTO_TFC_SELECTION (mode 2). 

When using auto TFC mode the TFC cycle table is not used. A UL TFC is selected to deliver the appropriate  
amount of data in a transport block set, based on the data received on the DL. 

Dynamic mode restrictions 

Automatic TFC selection only works for 1 TrCH. That is, the UL CCTrCH must only have a single TrCH. This  
also limits the number of TFs per TFC to 1.

                   For the automatic TFC selection to operate, there must be a UL TFC set up in the script that provides a TF with a  
                   TB size large enough to re-transmit the data received on the DL, and a TFC to provide a TF with a TB size of 0. 

                   Matching of UL and DL data rates is not checked (to allow the flexibility to use multiple TFC's on the DL). The

1.6                Using the IP Driver 

                   The IP device driver allows you to run an internet application on a PC, such as a Web Browser, and use the TM500  
                   to provide the air interface to the 3G network. The IP driver has the ability to route all IPv4 packets through to the  
                   3G network. 

                   This section provides examples that describe how to set up the TM500 and the IP device driver to trap all the data  
                   from the application and route it through the protocol layers of the Test Mobile. 

1.6.1              About configuring the TM500 IP driver 

                   The device driver provides a number of commands that you can use to route outgoing packets from the PC through  
                   the TM500 to the network. There is no need to route incoming packets as they are already addressed and are  
                   forwarded to their destination.  

                   These commands are: 

                      •   FORW PTE USERPTE DEVICE_INIT 

                          This command initialises the IP driver.  

                      •   FORW PTE USERPTE ADD ROUTE <PARAMETERS> 

                          This routes all traffic destined for a particular route address/mask to the 3G network.  

                          This specifies the destination route, subnet mask, radio bearer identity, and the radio access bearer identity.  
                          All packets that do not match the given criteria will be routed as specified. 

                      •   FORW PTE USERPTE ADD SOURCE <PARAMETERS> 

                          This routes all traffic from a source address to the 3G network. This specifies the source IPv4 address, the  
                          radio bearer identity and the radio access bearer identity. 

1.6.2              Configuring a Windows PC to use the TM500 as an internet gateway 

                   This example describes how to configure a Windows a PC to use the TM500 as gateway to the internet as shown  
                   in Figure 6.

                   Configure the IP Device Driver 

                   You must initialise the device driver using the FORW PTE USERPTE DEVICE_INIT command. Then you must  
                   configure the TM500 to route the network traffic output from your PC to a particular radio bearer within a RAB  
                   (Radio Access Bearer) on the TM500.

In this example, of the ADD SOURCE command would be: 

FORW PTE USERPTE ADD SOURCE 57.201.140.75 5 5 

This routes all data from the application on the PC (with the IP address 57.201.140.75) to radio bearer 5 of RAB  
5.The DL and UL RAB ID must both be 5 for the IP driver to correctly route the IP packets, in this example. 

Change the Default Gateway for your Ethernet adapter 

    1.  Open the Control Panel on your PC by selecting Control Panel from the Settings option in the Start  
       menu.  

    2. Double-click on Network icon. 

    3. Select the Protocols tab. 

    4. Double-click TCP/IP Protocol.  

       The TCP/IP Properties dialogue box is displayed 

       If the Specify an IP address radio button is checked and the IP Address, Subnet Mask and Default  
       Gateway are provided, change the Default Gateway to the data interface IP address of the Test Mobile.  

       If Obtain an IP address from a DHCP server is checked, you should copy the data displayed in the  
       ipconfig command and change Default Gateway to the address of the TM500.  

       For example, based on the example ipconfig command: 

       IP Address would be 57.201.140.75 

       Subnet Mask would be 255.255.248.0 

       Default Gateway would be 57.201.140.76 

                  In case of 2 PowerPC card configuration the slave PowerPC card will have the data interface IP  
                  address.

                     You must initialise the device driver using the FORW PTE USERPTE DEVICE_INIT command. Then you must  
                     configure it to route the output from the Web Browser on your PC to a particular radio bearer within a RAB (Radio  
                     Access Bearer) on the Test Mobile. 

                     ADD ROUTE has the syntax:

                             The DL and UL RAB ID must both be 5 for the IP driver to correctly route the IP packets. 

                             However, it is possible to configure the IP driver when the UL and DL use different RABs. To do this set  
                             the IP address of the DL RAB to 0.0.0.0 in the IP driver command. Then, in the ADD ROUTE command set  
                             the inverse parameter to 0, for the DL RAB id. 

                             For example, if UL has RAB ID of 5, and DL has RAB ID of 6:

    •   MAC-e Header 

       The MAC-e header contains optional scheduling information (not shown) which is used by the Node B  
       scheduling algorithm, and a series of Data Description Indicator (DDI) and N parameters. A final DDI  
       value may also be included in the header. This indicates the termination of the header and that the final bits  
       in the MAC-e PDU are for padding only.  

    •   Payload data 

       The payload data consists of multiple MAC-es PDUs. Each MAC-es PDU has a corresponding DDI and N  
       value in the MAC-e header.  

    •   Padding bits 

       The padding bits are applied by the UE to extend the MAC-e PDU to a length allowed by Layer 1. These  
       are discarded at the Node B and are not used by the Node B MAC-e entity.  

Within the infrastructure, the MAC-e function is performed by the Node B and the MAC-es function is performed  
by the SRNC. Data is passed up to the MAC-es in the form of MAC-es PDUs over the Iub interface and the DDI  
and N information associated with each MAC-es PDU is delivered using the Iub frame protocol. 

This division of the MAC-e and MAC-es functionality between the Node B and SRNC is implemented to support  
E-DCH soft handover between multiple Node Bs. In this type of scenario, each Node B could decode each L1  
Transport Block differently and send different ACK/NACK responses. As far as the UE is concerned, if the packet  
is received correctly by any Node B, then there is no need to retransmit. In practice, however, this means that a  
single Node B may not receive all of the MAC-e PDUs associated with an E-DCH service. As a consequence, there  
could be missing MAC-es PDUs at the Iub interface, and the ones that are present could be out of sequence because  
of HARQ retransmission procedures. 

The MAC-es reorders the MAC-es PDUs received from all Node Bs in the soft handover active set, and  
disassembles them into a stream of MAC-d PDUs. Each MAC-es PDU has an associated DDI value which provides  
an index to its MAC-d flow and MAC-d PDU size. Reordering is performed per MAC-d flow against the  
Transmission Sequence Number applied to the header of each MAC-es PDU by the UE. The reordered MAC-es  
PDUs can then be disassembled into MAC-d PDUs, the number of MAC-d PDUs within the MAC-es PDU being  
determined from the reported N value. 

MAC-d PDUs are passed up to the RLC, permitting further sequence checking and retransmission capabilities.

                    The MAC-e/MAC-i PDU test mode is shown in Figure 9. It enables verification of the functionality and operation  
                    of the Layer 1 DC-HSDPA processing and the Hybrid ARQ procedures. This test mode transmits complete  
                    MAC-e/MAC-i PDUs to the Node B. The MAC-e/MAC-i PDUs consist entirely of PN sequence or user-defined  
                    fixed frame data and do not contain any header information.

                    In this mode, the E-TFC to be transmitted each TTI must be scripted. The E-TFC is specified in a table for each  
                    HARQ process and each E-TFC from the table is retransmitted until an ACK is received on the downlink E-HICH.  
                    Alternatively, the user can script the Retransmission Sequence Number (RSN) to allow verification of the HARQ  
                    operation in the Node B. Rainy day scenarios can be configured by selecting whether the E-TFC table is advanced  
                    every TTI or only after the RSN indicates a successful transmission. 

                    Although grant information signalled on the E-RGCH and E-AGCH is not supported in this mode. However, it is  
                    still used by the GetStats command and for logging the data received on these channels and the E-HICH.  
                    Additionally, the Happy Bit can be scripted to verify its correct reception and decode at the Node B. 

                    An uplink R99 DCH can also be configured simultaneously with the E-DCH, with the data payload controlled via  
                    scripted commands.

2.3                  MAC-d PDU 

                    The MAC-d PDU test mode, illustrated in Figure 10, builds on the features provided by MAC-e/MAC-i PDU  
                    mode. It offers the same features of logging the downlink E-AGCH, E-HICH and E-RGCH, and the option to  
                    configure the uplink R99 DCH. However, instead of providing user data in the form of MAC-e/MAC-i PDUs, the  
                    data is configured as MAC-d PDUs. These are multiplexed and packaged into MAC-e/MAC-i PDUs by the  
                    MAC-e/es functionality in the TM500. This mode supports the header and padding bits of the MAC-e/MAC-i  
                    PDU.

                    Rather than specifying a E-TFC, the user specifies a combination of DDI and N parameters. Using these values,  
                    the Test Mobile concatenates multiple MAC-d PDUs from the same MAC-d flow into MAC-es/MAC-is PDUs,  
                     and then concatenates the MAC-es/MAC-is PDUs into the MAC-e/MAC-i PDU. In addition, the user can specify  
                     scripted scheduling information for inclusion in the MAC-e/MAC-i header. 

                    This mode provides similar options to MAC-e/MAC-i mode for using the received HICH or scripted RSN to verify  
                    HARQ functionality. However, grant information is not processed during evaluation of the amount of data that is  
                    transmitted.

2.4                 Layer 1/Layer 2 test mode 

                    The Layer 1/Layer 2 test mode, shown in Figure 11 provides the complete set of Layer 1 and Layer 2 features.  
                    Rather than scripting the DDI/N or E-TFC combinations that are transmitted each TTI, the TM500 uses the  
                    received grant information to calculate the contents of the data payload. Payload data can be sourced through the  
                    IP driver, allowing real-time TCP/IP services to be run over the E-DCH. Additionally, the Data Service Generator  
                    (see the TM500 Script Editor User Guide) provides a simplified means to simulate the payload associated with  
                    multiple real-time services such as voice calls, web browsing and gaming applications.

                                Layer 1 Configuration Commands 

                   This section describes the Layer 1 configuration commands in: 

                   About L1 configuration commands.........................................................................................................................43 

                   L1 configuration command descriptions.................................................................................................................45 

3.1                About L1 configuration commands 

                   TM500 provides two categories of L1 configuration commands: 

                       •  Commands that are translated into L1 primitives.  

                          The command field is translated into a L1 primitive and parameters are converted into primitive contents.  

                           Some L1 configuration commands require additional parameters (For example, data routing parameters).  
                          Where this is the case, the command parameters are specified before the L1 primitive parameters. 

                       •  Commands that are used to configure the L1TT.  

                          These include commands that instruct L1TT where to source and sink PHY data. 

                                                 Some commands (For example, CfgDLCCTrCH) can specify the time at which the  
                                                 command is activated. The command confirmation is typically received immediately,  
                                                 but an indication message is not returned until the command is activated by Layer 1 at  
                          :                      the activation time. Details are provided in the description of commands of this type. 

                   For L1 configuration command Indications, see Appendix C Indications. 

3.1.1              Parameter format 

                   Parameters are entered as decimal or hexadecimal. Hexadecimal parameters are prefixed by 0x, except where  
                   otherwise stated. 

3.1.2              Parameter checking 

                   L1 configuration command parameter ranges are checked by Layer 1. Out-of-range parameters result in an error.  
                   Layer 1 also checks some parameters that are destined for other layers (For example: CCB index). 

                   If you use the TM500 Script Editor to create scripts, parameter consistency in L1/L2 script is ensured automatically  
                   when required. However, if you write a L1/L2 script manually, parameter values that you set in L1 configuration  
                   commands must match those in Layer 2 commands. See Appendix F Inter-Dependency of Command Parameters.  

3.1.3              Optional parameters 

                   When defining a value for a parameter list for a command, it is necessary to specify all optional parameters unless  
                   they occur at the end of the parameter list. If a value is provided for an optional parameter in a particular command,  
                   then values must also be provided for all other optional parameters that appear before it in the parameter list. 

                   For example: 

                   In AddDLPhCH, if a value for the TPC_COMBINATION_INDEX parameter is defined then the parameter  
                   ALTERNATE_SCRAM_CODE_REQ must also be defined.

3.1.4              Error Messages 

                   The TM500 returns various error messages to indicate when an error has occurred. This might be due to parameters  
                   being incorrectly specified or by commands being used in the wrong order. 

                   If a serious unrecoverable error occurs, it is sometimes necessary to reset the L1TT and L1 components using the  
                   reset command (see Reset).  

                   See Appendix E L1 Return Codes for a list of error codes. 

3.1.5              E-DCH configuration prerequisites 

                   There are a number of prerequisites that must be observed to ensure reliable operation of DC-HSDPA: 

                      •   A DL and UL DCH must be configured before configuring the E-DCH, and the activation time of the  
                          E-DCH must be the same or later than that of the UL DCH. 

                      •   The DL and UL DCH Td values must be the same. 
                      •   The DL and UL DCH cannot be deleted while the E-DCH is active. It is necessary for both the DL and UL  
                          DCH end indications to have been received before attempting to delete the E-DCH. 

                      •   In MAC-d mode, the DDIs in the DDI cycle table (AddDDITableEntry) must first be defined using  
                          AddDDI. 

                      •   There must be a downlink DCH leg from each cell used in the E-DCH active set (that is, the E-DCH active  
                          set must be the same or a subset of the DCH active set). 

3.1.6              Four-Cell HSDPA configuration terminology 

                   4C-HSDPA operation 

                   The TM500 is capable of 4C-HSDPA operation if the platform software detects that there are 2 PowerPC and  7 DSP  
                   cards in the system. The TM500 will actually be configured for 4C-HSDPA operation if the UE category for  
                   HS-DSCH  is set to a value that indicates that the UE supports up to 4C-HSDPA that is in the range of category 29 to 32. 

                   The term 4C-HSDPA operation is specific to the TM500. 

                   Four-Carrier HSDPA operation 

                   Four Carrier HSDPA operation is characterized as simultaneous reception of up to four HS-DSCH transport  
                   channels. 

                    Certain categories of UEs may be configured with Four Carrier HSDPA operation with or without MIMO in  
                   CELL_DCH  state. Four Carrier HSDPA operation may be activated and deactivated using HS-SCCH orders. 

                   Since four carrier HSDPA is an extension of DC-HSDPA, most of the operations are same as or similar  to  
                   DC-HSDPA.  The TM500 supports carriers to operate in one or two different  RF bands depending on UE category. 

                   The term Four carrier HSDPA operation is 3GPP standard. 

                   Activation/Deactivation of secondary serving HS-DSCH cells 

                   When the TM500 is configured for Four carrier HSDPA operation, the secondary serving HS-DSCH cell can be  
                   activated (and deactivated) by orders from the eNode-B using HS-SCCH orders, or by L1 test commands.  

                   The term Activated/Deactivated secondary serving HS-DSCH cell is 3GPP standard

                                            Chapter 3 Layer 1 Configuration Commands 

                   When the TM500 is configured for 4C-HSDPA operation, a number of L1 commands are dependent on the HSDPA  
                   Cell Context, which can be set by using the SetCellContext command to select  the Primary serving cell, first  
                   secondary serving cell, second secondary serving cell or the third secondary serving cell (see SetCellContext). 

                   The term HSDPA Cell Context is specific to the TM500. 

                   RF frequency configuration 

                   When the TM500 is configured for Four carrier HSDPA operation, the radio frequency of the carriers can be distributed on  
                   single or dual band (e.g. 3:1,1:3, 2:2) The carrier frequency defined can be contiguous or non contiguous in a band  
                   (see STRT). The radio frequency of all the carriers on a single band must lie within 20Mhz bandwidth. 

                   If the user wants to test 4C-HSDPA and DC-HSUPA simultaneously then the primary and secondary carrier  
                   frequency must be contiguous in the band. 

                   The term primary and secondary carrier is specific to the TM500. 

3.1.7              Dual-Cell E-DCH configuration terminology 

                   DC-HSUPA operation 

                   The TM500 is capable of DC-HSUPA operation if the platform software detects that there are at least 5 DSP cards  
                   in the system. The TM500 will actually be configured for DC-HSUPA operation if the UE category for E-DCH is  
                   set to a value that indicates that the UE supports DC-HSUPA; that is either category 8 or 9.  

                   The term DC-HSUPA operation is specific to the TM500. 

                   Dual-Cell E-DCH operation 

                   When configured for DC-HSUPA operation, the TM500 system is capable of supporting Dual-Cell E-DCH  
                   operation using a Secondary Uplink Frequency. The system will actually be configured into Dual-Cell E-DCH  
                   operation by L1TT commands, and when in CELL_DCH state. 

                   The term Dual-Cell E-DCH operation is 3GPP standard. 

                   Activated Uplink Frequency 

                   When the TM500 is configured for Dual-Cell E-DCH operation, the E-DCH on the Secondary Uplink Frequency  
                   is activated (and deactivated) by orders from the eNode-B using HS-SCCH orders, or by L1 test commands 

                   The term Activated Uplink Frequency is 3GPP standard. 

                   E-DCH Cell Context 

                   When the TM500 is configured for DC-HSUPA operation, a number of L1 commands are dependent on the E-DCH  
                   Cell Context, which can be set by using the SetCellContext command to select either the Primary Uplink Frequency  
                   or the Secondary Uplink Frequency (see SetCellContext). 

                   The term E-DCH Cell Context is specific to the TM500. 

3.2                L1 configuration command descriptions 

                   This section provides descriptions of all L1 configuration commands, including specification of any additional  
                   command-specific L1TT_CONFIRMATION_STRING that can be received. The commands are listed  
                   alphabetically.

                   This command is used in the MAC-d test mode to add a new Data Description Indicator (DDI) entity. This is used  
                   to define an association with a data port (for the source of the data to be transmitted) and a MAC-d PDU size. In  
                   MAC-d test mode there is no distinction between MAC-d flows and logical channels. 

                   Multiple MAC-d PDU sizes can be supported for a single MAC-d flow by specifying the same Data Port for  
                   multiple DDIs.

                   The best-fit Layer 1 transport block size is calculated automatically from the DDI PDU size and N values (in  
                   accordance with TS25.321 Appendix B), and padding bits are added if required. The EndEDCH command fails if  
                   the resulting Layer 1 transport block size exceeds the maximum allowed by UE capability, maximum number of  
                   E-DPDCH channelisation codes and specified puncturing limit.

                    Description 

                    This command requests that Layer 1 configures and prepares to use a DL Physical Channel (DL PhCH). Layer 1  
                    sets up data structures required to handle the new DL PhCH and creates the first leg. 

                    Default values are used for optional parameters that are not specified by the user. 

                                       When the TM500 is configured for DC-HSUPA operation, and this command refers to a DL  
                                       Physical Channel that is an F-DPCH, then the command is associated with an E-DCH Cell  
                                        context. In this case, the SetCellContext command should be used to select whether this  
                                        command configures the F-DPCH associated with E-DCH operation on the Primary Uplink  
                                       Frequency, or on the Secondary Uplink Frequency.

                                                 This parameter indicates if there is another command to follow or if this is the  
                                                 last in a sequence: 
                                                 0 = No more commands, or this is the last in a sequence of commands 
                                                 1 = More commands to follow in a sequence of commands 
                                                 The COMMAND_TIME for the next command in the sequence is taken from

                   for a particular HARQ, either due to a NACK received on the E-HICH (and the max retry count not exceeded), or  
                   an RSN > 0 from the RSN Cycle Table, then the table entry used for the previous transmission on that HARQ is

                   Description 

                   This command is used in the MAC-d test mode to define the sequence of MAC-d PDUs to be sent in a MAC-i  
                   PDU. This item is specified for each HARQ process. 

                   The best-fit Layer 1 transport block size is calculated automatically based on the LCH-IDs configured and MAC-D  
                   PDU LENGTH values (in accordance with TS25.321 Appendix B), and padding bits are added if required. The  
                   SetupEDCH command fails if the resulting Layer 1 transport block size exceeds the maximum allowed by UE  
                   capability, maximum number of E-DPDCH channelisation codes and specified puncturing limit. 

                   The next table entry is selected for each HARQ on each new transmission. If a retransmission is required for a  
                   particular HARQ, either because a NACK is received on the HICH (and the maximum retry count has not been  
                   exceeded), or an RSN > 0 from the RSN Cycle Table, then the table entry used for the previous transmission on  
                   that HARQ is re-used. 

                   The LCH-ID referred to by this command must have been defined previously using the AddLch command. 

                   A maximum of 500 entries are allowed. 

                                     When the TM500 is configured for DC-HSUPA operation, this command is associated with an  
                                     E-DCH Cell context. In this case, the SetCellContext command should be used to select whether  
                                     this command configures E-DCH operation on the Primary Uplink Frequency, or on the  
                                      Secondary Uplink Frequency.

                  Description 

                  This command configures a UL Data Entity Fixed Frame Generator Data Entity (DEFFG) to provide a data source  
                  for UL transport channels. The DE instance is bound to a UL data port. On each transport channel TTI, a request  
                  is made for one TB of data. Each DEFFG supports up to NUM_FFG_BUFFERS worth of data, allowing different  
                  data for different transport blocks and different data per TTI.  

                                        The DEFFG is not aware of TTI boundaries and an internal buffer index is incremented on  
                                        each request. When the buffer index reaches NUM_FFG_BUFFERS the buffer index is reset  
                                        to zero. It is up to the user to ensure that enough buffers are configured to provide enough  
                  :                     unique data per TTI and TB for their needs.

                  DL_TRCH_START_INDEX). 

                  COMMAND_TIME defines the time the command is executed and is qualified by TIMING_TYPE to provide  
                  flexible timing configuration. For a non-BCH, a BCH must have been run to establish the LST-SFN timing. 

                  The IS_BCH parameter is used to inform the L1TT that the CCTrCH is to be used for a BCH which means that the  
                  LST-SFN timing is unknown. 

                  TTI_TIMING_KNOWN must also be set to 0 for a BCH. 

                  When L1 executes the command at the specified time, the Add DL CCTrCH indication on page 457 is displayed.  

                  A reconfiguration is performed if the command follows a DeleteCCB command with both referring to the same  
                  CCB, and the timing type is LAST_LST, and a shadow CCTrCH index is specified. 

                  The optional parameters are used to control the CCTrCH sync indication timing. Either all or none of the  
                  parameters should be specified.

                   This command configures the L1TT test mode for the E-DCH service. This command must be run before any cycle  
                   table entry commands. The TTI setting must match, and at least one reference E-TFCI must be valid for the  
                   associated SetupEDCH command.

                    This command requests that Layer 1 configure and prepare to use a PRACH physical channel and an AICH  
                    physical channel. Layer 1 sets up any data structures required to handle the new channels. This command only sets  
                    up the physical channels. An UL CCTrCH still needs to be set up as usual. 

                                        This parameter should be configured only in case of Enhanced Uplink.

3.2.41               CfgULCCTrCH 

                      Configure UL CCTrCH 

                      Description 

                     This command requests that Layer 1 configure and prepare to use an uplink CCTrCH. Layer 1 sets up any data  
                     structures required to handle the new CCTrCH.  

                          •   The physical channels referred to in the request must already exist (that is, must have been created by  
                              AddULPhCH). The only exception is for PRACH which does not need any physical channel creation. 

                          •   The transport formats, transport format combinations, and transport channels must already exist. 
                          •   The UL data entities should already have been set up and configured and have been bound to the UL data  
                              ports that are going to be used in this command.  

                     The TFC_MODE is used to control the selection of TFCs for uplink data transmission: 

                          •   TFC_MODE 0 uses the first entry in the TFCS. 
                          •   TFC_MODE 0 and 1 use the TFC cycle table to define the selected UL TFC 
                          •   TFC_MODE 2 uses automatic TFC selection when using a loopback data entity. 

                     For TFC_MODE 1 the cycle table must be configured before using this command using ClearStats, with the  
                     number of entries set in the NUM_TFC_CYCLE_TABLE_ENTRIES parameter. A new TFC is selected from the  
                     cycle table every 10ms. The cycle table entries must be set so that, for each TrCH, its TF only changes on a TTI  
                     boundary. 

                     Refer to Loopback configuration on page 32 for more information about TFC_MODE 2. 

                     The data ports are defined in DATA_PORT_LIST. This defines NUM_TRCH defined to provide the data ports to  
                     be used for TrCH 0 to TrCH(NUM_TRCH –1), where TrCH 0 is the first transport channel in the uplink transport  
                     channel table mapped to the CCTrCH (that is, with index UL_TRCH_START_INDEX). 

                     A BCH must have been run to establish the LST-SFN timing. 

                     COMMAND_TIME defines the time the command will be executed and its meaning qualified by TIMING_TYPE to  
                     provide flexible timing configuration. When L1 executes the command at the specified time, the Add UL CCTrCH  
                     indication is displayed. 

                     A reconfiguration is performed if the command follows a DeleteCCB, if both commands both refer to the same  
                     CCB, if the timing type is LAST_LST, and if a shadow CCTrCH index is specified. 

                                               TIMING_TYPE of ABSOLUTE_CFN (3) is supported, with the COMMAND_TIME in the range  
                                               0 … 255. This is required to synchronise L1 and MAC configuration.

                                           When the TM500 is configured for DC-HSUPA operation, this command is associated with an  
                                           E-DCH Cell context. In this case, the SetCellContext command should be used to select whether  
                                           this command configures E-DCH operation on the Primary Uplink Frequency, or on the  
                                           Secondary Uplink Frequency. When using the command for DC-HSUPA configuration, the  
                                           secondary serving E-DCH cell HSUPA service must be configured first, followed by the serving

                  NumTBs and NumBits are the total number of transport blocks and bits, respectively, transmitted at L1, including  
                  retransmissions. 

                  The NumTBsNACK, NumTBsACK and NumBitsACK are all based on the E-HICH physical channel transmitted  
                  to the UE over the air regardless of whether scripted or non-scripted mode is used. Every NACK received  
                  increments the NumTBsNACK field, which means that all retransmissions are taken into account. 

                  The NumTBsNewlyTransmitted is the number of transport blocks given to the HARQ process. 

                  NumTBsRetransmitted is the number of transport blocks retransmitted by the HARQ process.

                  Initialise E-DCH table sets 

                  Description 

                  This command initialises all the table sets (that is, ETFCI, DDI/N, RSN and Happy/SI cycle tables) of a particular  
                  index. Two sets of tables are provided to support reconfiguration. 

                                    When the TM500 is configured for DC-HSUPA operation, this command is associated with an  
                                    E-DCH Cell context. In this case, the SetCellContext command should be used to select whether  
                                    this command configures E-DCH operation on the Primary Uplink Frequency, or on the  
                                    Secondary Uplink Frequency.

                   Reconfigure HSDPA at Layer 1 

                   Description 

                   This command reconfigures the HSDPA protocol at L1 (CPHY) for the HS-DSCH cell specified by the L1TT  
                   command SetCellContext. In the default state, the reconfiguration applied to primary serving HS-DSCH cell. 

                   When two HS-DSCH cells are active, then the order of reconfiguration must be as follows: 

                       •   Secondary serving cell 
                       •   Primary serving cell 

                   Similarily if four HS-DSCH cells are active (4C-HSDPA) the order of reconfiguration must be: 

                       •   Third secondary serving cell 
                       •   Second secondary serving cell 
                       •   (first) secondary serving cell 
                       •   Primary serving cell 

                   Primary serving cellOptionally, the modification can be tied to the non-serving cell change order. Non-serving  
                   HS-SCCH service must be set up using the SetupHsScchNonServ command prior to configuring a ModifyHSDPA  
                   with non-serving cell change order. 

                   While using modification with cell change order and absolute start immediate timing (TIMIING_TYPE = 0 or 3  
                   and COMMAND_TIME= -1), the modification occurs within 40ms from the time the cell-change order is decoded  
                   at the non-serving cell.

                   This command configures the MAC-ehs in L1TT mode only. Configuration is optional and, if not provided, the  
                   MAC-ehs functionality is bypassed. This provides compatibility with the TM500 in L1 test mode. 

                   Only MAC-ehs PDUs with a good CRC are processed by the MAC-ehs. 

                   This command must be issued before HSDPA has been configured at L1 (that is, before SetupHSDPA). 

                   The EndHSDPA command indication automatically deletes the MAC-ehs configuration. 

                   If the command is received while there is an active MAC-ehs configuration then it is considered to be a  
                   reconfiguration.

                      the OLPC algorithm monitors the average BLER. The OLPC algorithm does not increment the target SIR if the  
                      average BLER exceeds a value determined by the combination of the maximum average BLER factor and the  
                      target BLER for the individual transport channels.

                  Without this command the secondary HSDPA cell will not be created; it must be. The command must be executed  
                  before performing a cell search to initialise the radio. 

                  In case of DC-HSDPA, the secondary serving HS-DSCH cell receive channel number is fixed next (either side) to  
                  the serving HS-DSCH cell receive channel as illustrated in Figure 12. See L1TT command SetRxIfOffset to specify  
                  the position of the secondary serving HS-DSCH cell.

In case of Dual Band DC-HSDPA, if the secondary serving HS-DSCH is non-adjacent to the serving HS-DSCH,  
see L1TT command SetSecRFFreqs to specify the receive frequency of the secondary HS-DSCH cell. 

When configured for DC-HSUPA the TM500 receives from two adjacent cells, and transmits on two adjacent  
uplink frequencies. The TX-RX frequency separation for the secondary serving cell is the same as the TX-RX  
frequency separation of the serving cell.

3.2.94            SetRxIfOffset 

                   Configure the IF offset  

                  Description 

                                     This command has been superseded by the command SetCarrierFrequency and     
                                     ActivateCarrierFrequency, which is used to set the RF frequencies explicitly per    carrier. The  
                                     command is retained for backwards compatibility. 

                  The L1TT command SetRxIfOffset configures an IF offset of -2.5MHz, or 0MHz, or +2.5MHz. This is to ensure  
                  that the two cells (each 5MHz) in DC-HSDPA can be placed within the 10MHz IF filter bandwidth. This command  
                  is not required when operating in DC-HSUPA+ (the default mode) when the Rx IF offset is set to 0MHz. 

                  This command is only accepted if a single radio card is selected. 

                  In DC-HSDPA TM500 should be configured as one of the following cases. 

                      •   Case 1: When Secondary serving cell frequency = Serving cell frequency - 5.0MHz

                    Description 

                    This command configures the searcher processor measurement requirements, including the reporting period and  
                    the monitoring set for both intra- and inter-frequency measurements. Cell measurements are made on the downlink  
                    frequency of the UE for intra-frequency measurements, and on up to two other frequencies for Inter-frequency  
                    measurements.  

                                        When the TM500 is configured for DC-HSUPA operation, this command is associated with an E-DCH  
                                        Cell context. In this case, the SetCellContext command should be used to select whether this command  
                                        configures searcher measurement reporting on the Primary downlink frequency, or on the secondary

                   This section provides descriptions of the Layer 1 test commands. It contains the following information:

4.1                About layer 1 test commands 

                   The Layer 1 Test Interface (L1TI) is used to configure the low-level operation of Layer 1. It is implemented to  
                   provide the TM500 with additional diagnostic capabilities that are outside the scope of normal Layer 1 operation.  
                   The interface is accessed using the MCI in a similar way to L1 configuration commands (see Layer 1 Configuration  
                   Commands on page 43) and the FORW command format is used to direct the commands to a specific component.  
                   The general syntax of a L1 test command is: 

                   FORW L1 <COMMAND> <PARAMETERS> 

                   The general rules for command formatting, and command responses are the same as for the L1TT.

    •   Enable forwarding of HS-DSCH data with CRC failures, and HS-SCCH data from L1 to L1TT 
    •   Allow test interface control of the HS-DSCH decode parameters.  

The HS-DSCH can be decoded using parameters decoded from the HS-SCCH, or parameters (3-9) passed in the  
test command. When the HS-SCCH BER is evaluated, the HS-DSCH can not be decoded using HS-SCCH control. 

The following modes are supported: 

 Mode           HS-DSCH decode         HS-SCCH BER           HS-DSCH BER 

 0              No                     Yes                   No 

 1              Test interface control No                     Yes 

 2              HS-SCCH control        No                    Yes 

 3              Test interface control Yes                   Yes 

HS-SCCH BER/BLER evaluation 

Modes 0 or 3 are used to evaluate the HS-SCCH BER/BLER.  

In mode 0, the HS-DSCH is not decoded.   Whereas in mode 3, the HS-DSCH is decoded using the parameters  
passed in this command. 

The CfgHSSCCHDP command must be used to associate the HS-SCCH data with a specific data port for  
evaluation,  

HS-DSCH BER/BLERevaluation 

Modes 1, 2, and 3 are used to evaluate HS-DSCH BER/BLER. 

In mode 2, the HS-DSCH is decoded using the signalled HS-SCCH parameters.  

In modes 1 and 3, the HS-DSCH is decoded using the parameters passed in this command. 

The SetupHSDPA or ModifyHSDPA command must be used to associate the HS-DSCH data with a specific data  
port for evaluation. 

When decoding the HS-DSCH using test interface control, the redundancy version (RV) and constellation version  
(CV) parameters can be set using one of the following methods: 

    •   Set the coded RV value, Xrv, using parameter 7. 
    •   Set the individual RV and CV parameters using parameters 7 to 9. Note the CV parameter C is only required  
        for 16 QAM decoding. 

For examples of how to use these test modes, see Bit error rate measurements on HS-SCCH and HS-DSCH on  
page 446.

4.2.17              ForceEDchBlockErrors 

                    Force E-DCH block errors 

                    Description 

                    This command forces E-DCH block errors at the receiver by inserting DTX in place of the E-DPDCH transmission.  
                    This technique ensures that the first self-decodable non-DTX retransmission that follows a forced block error,  
                    results in a CRC pass at the receiver. This is because the level of the received data from a non-DTX retransmission  
                    is greater than the level of the data in the HARQ IR buffers from any preceding DTX transmissions. Setting the  
                    RV_CONFIGURATION in the SetupEDCH command to 0, ensures that all retransmissions are self-decodable.  

                    The E-DPCCH transmission is not affected by this command, that is, it is transmitted as in normal operation. 

                    The command has two operating modes which can be set independently for each HARQ process: 

                        •   RAND_BLK_ERROR: 

                            Forces randomly distributed E-DCH block errors. The required BLER is set independently for each HARQ  
                            process.  

                            This mode is unaffected by the results received on the E-HICH.

    •  MIN_BLK_ERROR 

       Forces E-DCH block errors on the initial N transmissions of a given transport block where N can be set  
       independently for each HARQ process. 

       This mode takes into account the results received on the E-HICH for the given HARQ process. The Node  
       B is expected to respond to each of the initial N transmissions, for a given HARQ, with a NACK on the  
       E-HICH. If this is the case, TM500 forces block errors on the initial N transmissions, but correctly transmits  
       the (N+1)th transmission. However, if the Node B unexpectedly responds to one of the N initial  

       transmissions with an ACK, no more retransmissions are made, and the next transmission is the first  
       transmission of a new transport block. Again, TM500 forces block errors on the initial N transmissions of  
       the new transport block, unless an unexpected ACK is received on the E-HICH. 

       The maximum number of retransmissions for a UE is set by MAX_RETRANSMISSIONS in the  
       CfgEDCHTestMode command. A transport block will not be retransmitted more than  
       MAX_RETRANSMISSIONS times, even if N exceeds this value. 

                  This command is associated with an E-DCH Cell context. When the TM500 is configured for  
                  DC-HSUPA operation, the SetCellContext command should be used to select whether this  
                  command configures E-DCH operation on the Primary Uplink Frequency, or on the Secondary  
                  Uplink Frequency.

                    Description 

                    This command inserts a defined test pattern into the UL FBI bits when using closed loop Tx diversity. 

                    When activated (forceFbiBits 1 xxxx) in Closed Loop Mode 1 Transmit Diversity scenario, the downlink weights  
                    for Tx antenna 2 are updated according to FBI bit sequence. 

                    This allows to test NodeB Tx Antenna 2 for all values of Tx2 antenna weights. 

                    To force NodeB Tx2 antenna to a constant weight setting in Closed Loop Mode 1 Transmit Diversity scenario, the  
                    following parameters should be used: 

                        •   forceFbiBits 1 0: For constant 1*pi/4 phase of NodeB Tx2 
                        •   forceFbiBits 1 21845: For constant 3*pi/4 phase of NodeB Tx2 
                        •   forceFbiBits 1 32767: For constant 5*pi/4 phase of NodeB Tx2 (-3*pi/4)

                       Description 

                      This command configures the Cell Change Imitation (CCI) capability. This allows the user to simulate the effect  
                      of changing between HSDPA cells by providing the option to reset the HSDPA channels on a periodic basis. Using  
                      this feature allows investigation into the amount of HSDPA data that is lost during a cell change procedure. 

                      The command must be issued after HSDPA has been configured. The cell change imitation is performed on the  
                      cell specified in the preceding CPHY_HSDPA_SETUP REQ or CPHY_HSDPA_MODIFY_REQ command.  

                      Following initial configuration, the cell change limitation configuration restarts from the original start SFN if a  
                      CHPY_HSDPA_MODIFY_REQ is issued which results in a cell change. The configuration is automatically  
                      disabled on the termination of HSDPA. 

                                                 This command is ignored if a cell change imitation pattern is already active.

                   Description 

                   This command applies to a specific cell. It configures the thresholding algorithm for the received 16 QAM  
                   constellation on the selected cell. 

                   The algorithm is based upon the averaging of the I and Q components of the received 16-QAM symbols in order  
                   to determine the decision threshold for each constellation point. For best performance, the window period, N,  
                   should be set to the duration over which the channel fading remains approximately constant. For static channels, a  
                   large value for N is likely to yield the best results.

                     Description 

                     This command forces the ACK/NACK response in the HS-DPCCH to a specified sequence pattern for the  
                     HS-DSCH cell specified by SetCellContext. A table length of up to 5000 entries can be configured.This command  
                     must be used in conjunction with HsDpcchCqiTableData.  

                     The sequence pattern is transmitted in each sub-frame according to the minimum inter-TTI interval and the  
                     N_acknack_transmit parameters and is independent of signalling on the HS-SCCH. At the end of the table, the  
                     sequence is wrapped.

                   cell specified by SetCellContext. The command provides support for scripting of the HS-DPCCH in the following

                       •  HARQ and CQI/PCI are scripted 
                       •  HARQ is scripted, CQI/PCI uses measured values 
                       •  CQI/PCI is scripted, HARQ uses decoded values.

                               Chapter 4  Layer 1 Test Commands 

This command is an extension of the original command (is backwards compatible). The parameter  
SCRIPTED_HARQ_FEEDBACK_MODE defines whether HARQ scripted mode allows the HARQ to be scripted  
only on HS-DSCH detections. HARQ_TABLE_SIZE allows the HARQ table size to be different from CQI. 

Both CQI and ACK table entries must be defined (using HsDpcchCqiTableData and HsDpcchAckTableData  
commands) before this command is issued, and the tables should not be modified while this command is active. If  
MIMO is enabled then a PCI table must also be defined using HsDpcchPciTableData. 

The relative position of the scripted CQI and (HS-DSCH independent) HARQ values is guaranteed only if the test  
pattern is started before HSDPA is active. In this case the Nth value in the HARQ test pattern is transmitted in the  
same subframe as the (N+4)th value in the CQI test pattern. 

Also, the test pattern is not automatically stopped when HSDPA is deleted. If HSDPA is then re-started it is the  
responsibility of the user to stop or re-start the test pattern as required. 

It is recommended that TABLE_SIZE is always an integer multiple of N_cqi_transmit, otherwise the sequence  
may wrap incorrectly. If this constraint is observed, the period of the CQI sequence is: 

        (TABLE_SIZE / N_cqi_transmit) × CQI feedback cycle. 

When MIMO is enabled, some further caution is needed to ensure correct wrapping. The Node B expects CQI type  
A and type B reports in a pattern of M CQI values, as defined by the N_cqi_typeA / M_cqi ratio. The value of M  
may be in the range 1…10, but the pattern resets when CFN wraps to zero, (that is, every 2560ms). To ensure that  
the pattern wraps consistently, it is recommended that the TABLE_SIZE is an integer multiple of: 

        N_cqi_transmit × (2560ms / CQI feedback cycle). 

The test pattern is not automatically stopped when HSDPA is deleted. If HSDPA is then re-started it is the  
responsibility of the user to stop or re-start the test pattern as required. 

                    When the TM500 is configured for DC-HSUPA operation, this command is associated with an  
                    E-DCH Cell context. In this case, the SetCellContext command should be used to select whether  
                    this command configures E-DCH operation on the Primary Uplink       Frequency, or on the  
                    Secondary Uplink Frequency.

                        The E-HICH is decoded as a tertiary value (–1,0,+1). Therefore, a decode threshold is required to distinguish  
                        between a DTX and ±1 transmission. The decode threshold is derived from the expected received level of an  
                        E-HICH transmission (that is, ±1). 

                        It is assumed that the E-HICH is transmitted with a fixed offset relative to the CPICH. This command allows the  
                        user to set the E-HICH to CPICH transmit power ratio used to derive the decode threshold.

                 Description 

                 This command issues a HsScch Order to the serving HSDPA cell. It allows you to simulate an HsScch order  
                 scenario without actually sending the order using the Hs-Scch channel. The parameters supported and their naming  
                 conventions are from section 4.6C of 25.212. The order takes effect immediately.. 

                                   This command will only take effect if an HSDPA service is already active.

4.2.59            SetRgDecodeThreshold 

                  Set E-RGCH decode threshold 

                  Description 

                                   The SetRgDecodeThreshold command has been superseded by the SetHiRgDecodeMode  
                                   command which is used to set the decode mode and the E-RGCH to CPICH transmit power  
                                   ratio. However, SetRgDecodeThreshold is supported for backwards compatibility. 

                  The E-RGCH is decoded as a tertiary value (–1,0,+1). Therefore, a decode threshold is required to distinguish  
                 between a DTX and ±1 transmission. The decode threshold is derived from the expected received level of an  
                  E-RGCH transmission (that is, ±1). 

                  It is assumed that the E-RGCH is transmitted with a fixed offset relative to the CPICH. This command allows the  
                  user to set the E-RGCH to CPICH transmit power ratio used to derive the decode threshold. 

                                   This command is associated with an E-DCH Cell context. When the TM500 is configured for  
                                   DC-HSUPA operation, the SetCellContext command should be used to select whether this  
                                   command configures E-RGCH operation associated with the E-DCH on the Primary Uplink  
                                   Frequency, or on the Secondary Uplink Frequency.

                   and their CPICH power difference. 

                                     The command is specifically used for testing DC-HSUPA for Soft HandOver 
                                     The following should be ensured: 
                                         •   The non-serving cells on primary and secondary carrier supported from the same NodeB are present  
                                             in the network. 

                   In the configured cell pair, the secondary cell CPICH power is assumed to be equal to primary cell CPICH power  
                   plus a configured power difference. Also F-DPCH timing of secondary cell is tied to the paired primary cell i.e. the  
                   timing of paired cell is assumed to be same. 

                   This command can be issued after STRT command. The maximum four secondary cell can be configured using the  
                   above command. If the user configures more than 4 pair then old entries will be overwritten with new cell pair

5.1                      About Layer 2 commands 

                         Layer 2 commands are entered using the MCI, in a similar way to L1 Configuration and L1 Test Commands (see  
                         Command addressing syntax on page 18). The FORW command prefix is used to address the commands to the  
                         PTE and the general syntax of a Layer 2 command is: 

                                                        There are no optional parameters for PTE commands. All parameters must be included in the  
                                                        command and zeroes must be used for unspecified parameter. The TM500 Script Editor  
                                                        always generates the correct number of parameters. 

                         : 

                         FORW PTE L2_COMMAND <PARAMETERS> 

                         For example: 

                         FORW PTE CRLC_CONFIG_TX_AM_ESTABLISH_REQ 5 0 336 0 08 2 4 4 100 500 0 0 200 128 4 0  
                         4 0 0 0 

                         The general rules for command formatting, and command responses are the similar to other commands. 

                         Parameter checking 

                         The PTE does not perform any syntax checking errors, but does return a general error if L2 asserts. L2 asserts when  
                         a parameter is out of range.  

                                                        When you are writing a L1/L2 script manually, parameter values that you set in L1  
                                                        configuration commands must match those you set in Layer 2 commands. See Appendix F  
                                                        Inter-Dependency of Command Parameters. 

                         : 

                         Parameter consistency in L1/L2 scripts is automatic when you use the TM500 Script Editor. 

5.2                      Packet-switched data commands 

                         This section describes the packet-switched data commands for TM500 DC-HSDPA. These commands should be  
                         used when the service is one that can be classed as packet data, (for example, UL/DL 64k channel). The packet  
                         data implementation cannot accommodate more that 1 RB per RAB.

5.6.2              MAC_E_CONFIG_ETFCI_SELECTION_REQ 

                   Configure MAC-E E-TFCI selection 

                   Description 

                   This command allows the user to override the E-TFCI value computed by the MAC-e/es with a user defined value. 

                   If a user-defined E-TFCI is specified then the following conditions apply: 

                      •   The generation of the MAC-e PDU header behaves as normal and DDI/N pairs are generated for each  
                          MAC-es PDU carrying L2 data. The DDI-0 marker (all 1s) is used to terminate the header if uplink  
                          scheduling information is included. 

                      •   Providing that there is data in the RLC buffers, the specified E-TFCI and the corresponding transport block  
                          size is transmitted in each TTI. If the amount of data in the RLC buffers is less than the specified transport  
                          block size, padding bits are added. 

                      •   If there is no Layer 2 data to be transmitted (that is, the RLC buffers are empty), then the MAC-e PDU is  
                          filled with the DDI-0 marker (all 1s) and uplink scheduling information. Note that this behaviour represents  
                          a deviation from the 3GPP specifications. 

                   The default operation is to use the computed E-TFCI value. 

                                     When the TM500 is configured for DC-HSUPA operation, this command is associated with an  
                                     E-DCH Cell context. In this case, the SetCellContext command should be used to select whether

                  Description 

                  This command configures the MAC-e use of RG information received on the E-RGCH.  

                  The RG_ONESHOT parameter is the equivalent of receiving a single relative grant command. It is necessary to  
                  issue multiple MAC_E_CONFIG_RG_REQ commands for repeated relative grant adjustments. 

                                    When the TM500 is configured for DC-HSUPA operation, this command is associated with an  
                                    E-DCH Cell context. In this case, the SetCellContext command should be used to select whether  
                                    this command configures E-DCH operation on the Primary Uplink       Frequency, or on the  
                                     Secondary Uplink Frequency.

6.1               About layer 3 Test Commands 

                  Layer 3 commands are entered using the MCI, in a similar way to L1 Configuration and L1 Test Commands (see  
                  Command addressing syntax on page 18). The FORW command prefix is used to address the commands to the  
                  Layer 3.  

                  The general syntax of a Layer 3 command is: 

                  FORW L3 <COMMAND> <PARAMETERS> 

                  For example: 

                  FORW L3 RRCSetRfFreq 1 0 21400 19500 

                  The general rules for command formatting, and command responses are the similar to other commands. 

6.2               Layer 3 Test Command Descriptions 

6.2.1             RRCSetRfFrequency 

                  Sets DL and UL frequencies for a cell 

                  Description 

                  This command defines the values of carrier frequencies at Layer 3 for primary/secondary cells. This command can  
                  be used to override the values of frequencies corresponding to parameters given by the SETP command (please  
                  refer to the Protocol Reference Manual). 

                  The carrier frequencies (both Rx/Tx) of the primary cell are always required. 

                  The carrier frequencies for all the cells need to be provided in one single command. 

                  Syntax 

                  FORW L3 RRCSetRFFreq <Parameters>

7.1                   About MCI administration commands 

                     All Layer 1 Configuration, Layer 1 Test and Layer 2 MCI Commands are sent to the TM500 using the Mobile  
                      Control Interface (MCI). These commands use a prefix to identify the target element within the TM500 (for  
                      example, FORW, described in previous chapters). In addition to the commands used to set up and control tests,  
                     there are a number of commands that use the MCI for the administration of the TM500 itself. 

                      The general syntax for these commands is: 

                      COMMAND [PARAMETER1 PARAMETER2 … PARAMETERn] 

                                           In general, if you are controlling the TM500 in the normal way using the MDL, you do not need  
                                           these commands because MDL automatically sends commands such as STRT, RBOT, and SCFG  
                                           to the TM500 from the MDL GUI. The main use is in scripts and in command strings created  
                      :                    within the Mobile Data Logger (MDL) (see the TM500 Mobile Data Logger User Guide). 

7.2                   Utility MCI command descriptions 

                      This section describes the MCI commands that are used to configure and manage the TM500. 

7.2.1                 ABOT 

                      Set automatic reboot options 

                      Description 

                      This command is used to set the automatic reboot options for the TM500. The TM500 and MDL continuously  
                      check the status of the MCI and can trigger an automatic reboot to recover from script errors and communication  
                      failures. The settings are not persistent and are returned to their default values by an MCI disconnection. However  
                     you can use a start up script to configure a persistent automatic reboot, as described below in this section. 

                                               This command should be used before SCFG but can be used at any time. 

                      : 

                      If the MCI_TICK_INDICATION parameter is enabled, a I: TICK indication is sent periodically to the MDL by  
                     the TM500 and appears in any logs files that are recorded.

                     This command forces a software reload by the test mobile Software (that is, a reboot). This request is equivalent  
                     to powering OFF and then ON again and causes all cards within the TM500 to reset and execute its normal boot

                     This command resets the test mobile mode, allowing a new mode to be subsequently set. 

                     Each component within the TM500 responds to the RSET request, but only one overall confirmation message is  
                     sent to the user.  

                     The TM500 derives the overall RETURN_CODE and RETURN_TEXT fields in the confirmation message from  
                     the return code response of all components in the system. 

                     If all components return 0 then the overall return code is 0. If one or more components respond with a non-zero  
                     return code, then the return code for each failed component is returned to indicate the failure condition. See MCI

                     Description 

                     This command starts TM500 operation. it is used to indicate the start of normal operation after a mobile mode has  
                     been configured and default parameter values amended. 

                     Each component within the test mobile responds to the STRT request, but only one overall confirmation message  
                     is sent to the user. The mobile derives the overall RETURN_CODE and RETURN_TEXT field in the confirmation  
                     message from the return code response of all components in the system. 

                     If all components return 0 then the overall return code is 0. If one or more components respond with a non-zero  
                     return code, then the return code for each failed component is returned to indicate the failure condition. See MCI

7.3                  Error recovery and reset commands 

                     The TM500 provides a number of different reset mechanisms that can be used to recover from various types of  
                     error. 

7.3.1                RBOT 

                     Reload (or reboot) 

                      Description 

                     This command performs the equivalent of a power-cycle on the TM500, causing all TM500 software to be reloaded  
                     from the FTP server or flash memory as appropriate. Reload is available under all circumstance where a software  
                     crash is suspected, enabling remote restarting of the TM500 to be performed. 

                                               This command causes loss of the MCI socket connection 5 seconds after the command  
                                               confirmation is issued. Any application using the MCI should close its socket immediately  
                                               on receipt of the confirmation.

                        Description 

                        This command performs a software reset of the L1TT and L1 components (including the DSPs). It is only available  
                        in L1 test tool mode (L1TTL1), and is used to recover from errors where commands have been issued in the wrong  
                        sequence, or in the wrong state. 

                                                    In L1 test tool mode the Layer 1 Reset is the preferred operational error recovery mechanism.

                        Confirmation messages returned by the TM500 have the following format: 

                        C: CCCC RETURN_CODE RETURN_TEXT [CONFIRMATION_STRING] 

                        where:

                                            unable to send the Command to the component.

                                            A Command was entered that is not valid in the  
                                            current Test Mobile state. See the next table. 

Example 

A successful confirmation to the GETP command might be: 

 C: GETP 0x00 Ok DPDCH_GAIN 0x00000001 

Where 0x00000001 is the value of parameter DPDCH_GAIN 

All MCI confirmation messages are terminated by a null character (\0), which is normally preceded by new line  
and carriage return characters. Confirmation messages can contain multiple new line and carriage return characters. 

All numerical parameters are returned in unsigned 32-bit hexadecimal format unless otherwise specified. All  
hexadecimal numbers are returned with a prefix of 0x. Parameters are padded with leading zeros unless otherwise  
specified. 

If a command fails then, depending upon the reason for failure, some of the command confirmation parameters  
returned may not be valid.  

The normal confirmation string for a command might be replaced with a failure text field if the command fails in  
a serious way. For example: 

 C: [CCCC] RETURN_CODE RETURN_TEXT [FAILURE_TEXT]

                   If a four-letter command is not found in the request command then the command field (CCCC) is omitted from the  
                   confirmation. The white space delimiters on each side remain.  

7.5                MCI Indications 

                   Indication messages originate inside the TM500 to inform the user of the occurrence of an event. The TM500 may  
                   therefore send an Indication message on the MCI at any time. 

                   Indication messages from the TM500 have the following format: 

                    I: IIII [INDICATION_STRING] 

                   where IIII is the four letter indication message type. 

7.5.1           Error Indications 

                   The Test Mobile supports two error types: 

                       •   Status errors 
                       •   Notification errors 

                   Status error 

                   A Status Error Condition Set Indication is sent on the MCI interface on the first occurrence  of a Status Error event.  
                   Subsequent occurrences of the error event do not generate Status Error Indication messages until the Status Error  
                   has been cleared by the user (using the Clear Error Status Condition Command).  

                    Notification errors 

                   A notification error indicates that a particular error event has occurred within the Test Mobile. Notification errors  
                   may re-occur.  

                   Status Errors are used to avoid flooding the MCI interface with error messages that may occur repeatedly. The user  
                   is normally required to take some action to remove the cause of a status error before clearing it. The action the user  
                   is expected to take is shown in the table below. 

                    Error status condition         Meaning                        Action 

                    0x0                            Logging Queue Full Status      Reduce number of items for logging, then clear the status error  
                                                   Error                          (using CESC).

                                                   Status Error                   (using CESC). 

                    0x4                            No Logging Connection          A Logging connection has not been made or has been lost.  
                                                   Status Error                   Perform a reset (RSET) and Set Mode before attempting to  
                                                                                  re-establish a Logging connection.  

                   If any other error status conditions are reported please contact Aeroflex. 

                   The category of error is indicated by the ERROR_LEVEL value shown in the table below: 

                    Error Level      Meaning

8.1                About user data commands 

                   These commands require the prefix USERPTE to allow the commands to be executed from the MCI. 

                   The syntax of a user data command is therefore: 

                   FORW PTE USERPTE USER_DATA_COMMAND <PARAMETERS> 

                   Optional parameters are handled in the USERPTE interface. 

8.1.1              Data entities 

                   The data entities supported in the PTE are shown in Table 1, and the commands used to configure them are  
                   described in User command descriptions.The abbreviations used in the table are as follows:

                   If both PS and CS are used, then the RB limits are combined. However, the limit of the combined total is 11 RABs  
                   (for example, 5 CS RABs and 6 PS RABs), giving 21 RBs.

                   Table 1 shows the list of data entities available and how they should be combined with the domain and RLC mode.  
                   In addition, there are also some restrictions about the mapping of data entities to RABs and RABs to RBs. The  
                   following diagrams illustrate the correct usage for each type of data entity in the system. 

8.2.1              Sink / Source 

                   The data entity types for SINK or SOURCE should be used to connect separate sockets to the UL and DL, where  
                   the UL SOURCE socket transmits RLC SDU data and the DL SINK socket receives RLC SDU data.

8.2.3              Stream 

                   The STREAM data entity should be used for application that sends and receives data on the same socket. The  
                   configuration applies as shown in Figure 20. The IDs for RAB and RB must be the same in order for this to work  
                   properly.

                          •   RLC TM should not be used with an UL socket, as the IP connection cannot guarantee to provide an SDU  
                              size to match the RLC PDU size.

8.2.5                Data Profile 

                     The Data Profile, (also known as Data Service Generator) is used when a predetermined sequence or pattern is  
                     required for UL transmission. The format of this data is either a PN sequence or a repeating byte, and the  
                     characteristic over time is determined by allowing multiple entries at a certain time interval. 

                     This data entity is for the UL only.

                 operates in the OFF mode by default, which means data is sent to L2 at the rate configured by the PTE data entity.  
                 If set to ON, L2 controls the maximum rate at which data is fed into it, based on whether an SDU transmission  
                 would result in an RLC discard.

A.1                   R99 commands 

                      This section provides command sequences for UL and DL configuration, deletion, and reconfiguration. 

A.1.1                 UL and DL R99 configuration 

                      The commands for R99 configuration are divided into two sections: 

                          •    Commands that are timing independent 
                          •    Commands that have a timing associated with them (for example, CFN or SFN) 

                      The non time-critical commands shown in Table 3 should be run before the time-critical ones shown in Table 4.  
                      This is done to harmonise the command ordering, so that the same order can be used for both UL and DL, and for  
                      reconfiguration.  

                      The commands shown are for DL TM, but can also be used for UL TM, and for UM and AM. However, the uplink  
                      must be defined before the downlink if using AM because the RLC configuration command for the DL AM entity  
                      cross-references the UL AM entity. 

                      It is also important to configure both the transmit and receive components of the Layer 2 RLC before the first data

A.1.4                 UL and DL R99 reconfiguration 

                      Reconfiguration is used to switch the TM500 between services (for example, to provide a different data rate) while  
                      maintaining the uninterrupted flow of data. Reconfiguration is necessary when operating in L1L2 mode in the  
                      following cases:  

                           •   If physical channel reconfiguration occurs at L1. In L1L2 mode the MAC CCTrCH can be left intact by  
                               re-using the original TrCH IDs. 

                           •   If the characteristics of the TrCh have changed, both Layer 1 and the MAC must be reconfigured.  
                           •   If any of the Layer L2 parameters, such as RLC mode or data entity characteristics are changed, such as  
                               switching to a different service. 

                      Modification of the HS-DSCH at both L1 and MAC is supported in the same way as R99 channels. 

                      The method used to reconfigure Layer 1 to is to use shadow channels that co-exist with the original services until  
                      the reconfiguration time occurs. Shadow channels cannot be used at Layer 2 and the timing of Layer 2 is  
                      synchronised with Layer 1 by using the CFN time.  

                      The command ordering for UL and DL R99 reconfiguration is shown in Table 7. 

                                                 It is essential that absolute CFN timing is used to synchronise reconfiguration on Layer 1 and  
                                                 Layer 2. Do not use immediate, relative, or absolute SFN timing. See Layer 1 and Layer 2

A.4                L1L2 reconfiguration using shadow channels 

                   Reconfiguration is used to switch the TM500 to another service that, for example, provides a different data rate,  
                   while maintaining the flow of data. The method used in L1 to perform a reconfiguration is by the use of shadow  
                    channels that co-exist with the original services until the reconfiguration time has occurred. L2 operates slightly  
                    differently as there is no concept of a shadow channel, although the timing is synchronised with L1 by the use of  
                   the CFN time.  

                   Reconfiguration is necessary when operating in L1L2 mode in the following cases. In each case the flow of data  
                   must be maintained across the original and reconfigured services. 

                       •   A physical channel reconfiguration at L1. That is the physical channel characteristics have been modified.  
                           In L1L2 mode the MAC CCTrCH can be left as is by re-using the original TrCH IDs. 

                       •   If the characteristics of the TrCh have changed, both L1 and the MAC must be reconfigured. Data must be  
                           maintained across the change from the old service to the new one. 

                       •   If any of the L2 parameters, such as RLC mode or data entity characteristics need to be changed, a full L1L2  
                           reconfiguration should support this, maintaining the flow of data. This is the case used when switching to a  
                           different service. 

                       •   Modification of the HS-DSCH at both L1 and MAC is supported in the same way as R99 channels.

This is the default case that should be used if the service is to be switched between different data rates, as usually  
the UL data entity must change to cope with the change in data. This scenario can be extended to switch back and  
forth between the two sets of configurations, while leaving the data entities, RABs and RBs intact. 

Alternatively, the data entities, RABs and RBs can be deleted after the service has been switched, but this must be  
delayed until the indication CMAC_REMOVE_RX_CCTRCH_IND has been received to ensure that the  
reconfiguration has occurred.

                    This appendix provides extracts from example scripts that demonstrate how to control the TM500 using the  
                    commands described in this document. All of the scripts have been produced using the TM500 R10 HSPA Script  
                    Editor (see the TM500 R10 HSPA Script Editor User Guide). Using the Script Editor makes it easier to produce  
                   valid scripts. It guarantees correct command sequencing and ensures that all parameters are correctly specified.

                    script files. The script file initialises the TM500, sets up the R99 channels, sets up HSDPA channels, sets up  
                    HSUPA channels, and then terminates the test.

                  This section provides a complete test sequence for Layer 1/Layer 2 Mode. The script comprises one group file and  
                  four script files. The script file initialises the TM500, sets up the R99 channels, sets up HSDPA channels, sets up  
                  HSUPA channels, and then terminates the test.

                  sequence of Script Editor commands shown in Figure 29. For information about using the Script Editor, refer to  
                  the TM500 R10 HSPA Script Editor User Guide.

B.3               Bit error rate measurements on HS-SCCH and HS-DSCH  

                 This section provides some example scripts that configure the HS-SCCH and HS-DSCH at Layer 1 to use the Bit  
                 Error Rate (BER) measurement capabilities of the TM500.The BER measurements are performed against a PN  
                 data sequence transmitted by the Node B on these channels. 

                 The examples are: 

                     •  Mode 0: HS-SCCH BER measurement 
                     •  Mode 1: HS-DSCH BER measurement 
                     •  Mode 2: HS-DSCH BER (HS-SCCH control) measurement 
                     •  Mode 3: HS-SCCH and HS-DSCH BER measurement

                                          The HSUPA commands AddEDCHCell, DeleteLeg, ModifyEDCH, and SetupEDCH can be  
                                         used in sequence by setting the FURTHER_COMMANDS parameter to 1. An indication is  
                                          only received for the first command in the sequence (that is, no indications are received for  
                   :                      any other commands that follow in the sequence).

  Inter-Dependency of Command Parameters 

To ensure the correct operation of the TM500, there are command parameters that must have the same value when  
used in commands for different components. 

The following table indicate the parameter variables to which this rule applies. The table shows the components  
that use these variables, and the commands in which they are sent. 

Where a parameter applies to a setup for both uplink and downlink, the variables should match where used in the  
same direction. TX = UL, RX = DL.
